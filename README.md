# My Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains the latest version of my CV along with its LaTeX source code. 
The CV is based on the "AltaCV | NicolasOmar Fork" template.

The "create-cv.sh" shell script is used to parse the main.tex source file, and produce the "*.pdf" CV file, which includes 
the most recent date in its file name.
To run the "create-cv.sh" script you will need to have the LaTeX compiler installed, as well as the Font Awesome 5 free icon set.
